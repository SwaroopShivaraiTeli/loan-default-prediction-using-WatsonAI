# 💳 Loan Default Prediction using IBM AutoAI

This project uses **IBM Watson Studio's AutoAI** to build and evaluate machine learning models for predicting **loan status** (e.g., *Fully Paid*, *Charged Off*, *Current*). The data comes from a structured loan dataset with fields such as loan amount, interest rate, grade, term, and more.

## 💻 AutoAI Notebook

The notebook used for training and evaluating the pipeline was auto-generated by IBM Watson Studio:

- Includes preprocessing, training, evaluation
- Compatible with Python 3.11 and `scikit-learn 1.3`
- Editable and deployable via IBM Cloud or locally

```python
pipeline.fit(X_train.values, y_train.values.ravel())
score = scorer(pipeline, X_test.values, y_test.values
